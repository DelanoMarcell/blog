Hi, my name is Delano Martin, and I’m a software engineer.

Welcome to my blog. I started this blog as a way to reinforce my learning through writing. It serves as a space to organize my thoughts and document my software dev journey. On here you'll find me talking about everything dev, from tutorials and personal experiences, to insights and opinions. When I’m not coding or blogging, you’ll probably find me playing video games with my friends.

Thanks for visiting — I hope you read something valuable here. Comment on things you find interesting.

Check out my linkedin [here](https://linkedin.com/in/delanomartin) and my personal site [here](https://delanomartin.com).
