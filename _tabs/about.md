My name is Delano Martin, and I’m a software engineer.

I started this blog as a way to reinforce my learning through writing. It serves as a space to organize my thoughts and document my software dev journey. When I’m not coding or blogging, you’ll probably find me playing video games with friends.

Thanks for visiting — I hope you find something valuable here. Please read a post and let me know your thoughts by leaving a comment.
